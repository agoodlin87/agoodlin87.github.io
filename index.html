    <h2>Hi! My names Adam!</h2>
    <p>I am 32 years old and currently reside in Latrobe, PA. Its a small town with a lot of character.
      I have a beautiful wife, Brittany. I also have 2 children, Oliver (2 years old) and Logan (3 months).
      I have been in Information Technology for the past 8 years and enjoy what I do everyday. As of lately,
      I have had a facination with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I love the idea of creating an idea that is presented to me.
      I always have possessed the ability to bring to life ideas and concepts.
